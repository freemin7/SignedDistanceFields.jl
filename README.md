# SignedDistanceFields.jl

SignedDistanceFields.jl provides primitive Signed Distance functions in 3 dimensions and ways to combine them. The resulting scene tree can be turned into a single Julia function which has all relevant information inlined and is in something approximating [static single assigment form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form). This allows for faster execution then walking a tree with each call of the signed distance function of the total scene.
In the future running these functions on the GPU or implementing scene graph specific optimization are possible.

A simple raymarching engine with a scene and some simple shaders are provided in the example folder.

## Getting Started

Build a scene tree by combining primitives 
```
scene = SUnion((Trans(Sphere(5*sqrt(2),4),space(0.0,-10.0,0.0)),
    Trans(Sphere(5*sqrt(2),5),space(0.0,5.0,8.66)),
    Trans(Sphere(5*sqrt(2),6),space(0.0,5.0,-8.66)),
    Plane(space(1.0,0.0,0.0),2),
    RepQ(Trans(Sphere(0.5,1),space(2.5,2.5,2.5)),5.0),
    Trans(Sphere(10.5,3),space(0.0,0.0,0.0))))
```
Turn the scene in to a `SingFunc` struct which is an array of Julia Expresseion and an initial symbol.
```
SF = to_code(scene)
```
Decice whether you want to evaluate it for a certain value `exec(SF,value)` or if want to build a function `func(SF,:Type)`. Please note due to historic reasons `:Type` is restricted to the space type provided by the package (which is `SVector{3,Float64}` )

### Prerequisites

```
] add MacroTools, StaticArrays, LinearAlgebra, Images, ColorVectorSpace, Colors, Dates
```
Should get you all dependencies for the example.
